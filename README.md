As a way of making use of old functions and unfinished projects I've 
made this repo to store the bits of code I've used or found handy.

The types of things I write scripts for are exploring web pages, making 
graphs in R, investigating things on my home network and just playing 
around to learn something new.

I make no guarantee as to the quality of the code, or that best 
practises are followed. However it got it got the job for me at some 
point, may be handy again, and maybe it can help someone else if they're 
stuck.

I generally try to comment where I find code as comments within the 
files. So look out for those if you're wanting more information.
